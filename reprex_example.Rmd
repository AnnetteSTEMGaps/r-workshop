## reprex is a “workflow package”. That means that it’s something we don’t put in Rmds, scripts, or anything else. We use is in the Console when we are preparing to ask for help — from ourselves or someone else.

```{r setup, warning=FALSE}
library(reprex)
```
## If I had a question about this code, I select the code, copy it, then go into console and just type reprex() and magic happens, ready to paste anywhere, like as an issue, in an email, etc.
```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Another example using built-in mtcars dataframe
```{r example2, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>% 
  filter(mpg > 26)
```
